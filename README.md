# DCD-MUSIC: Deep-Learning-Aided Cascaded Differentiable MUSIC Algorithm for Near-Field Localization of Multiple Sources
## ABSTRACT:
Future wireless technologies will require accurate localization of multiple users  in the radiative near-field. A leading family of algorithms is based on subspace decomposition of the input covariance and localization by peak-finding over the \ac{music} spectrum, which is suitable for non-coherent sources with sufficient snapshots and calibrated arrays. This work introduces {\em \ac{dcdmusic}} that augments \ac{music} near-field localization with dedicated \acp{dnn}, allowing it to operate reliably and interpretably.  \ac{dcdmusic} utilizes two \acp{dnn} trained to produce two surrogate covariances, one from which the angles and number of sources is recovered, and one used to compute the range \ac{music} spectrum. This is achieved by introducing a novel learning method that $(i)$ facilitates division into signal and noise subspaces; and $(ii)$ converts \ac{music} into a differentiable machine learning model. Our results  show that \ac{dcdmusic} successfully localizes multiple coherent near-field and far-field sources.
